  - a way to redirect to one of the below sections elegantly
- a section to present the concept with small squares or small text
- a section where you can create your new event directly (as if you would be logged-in)
  - upon creation, the user is redirected to a capability to login or register
  - the creation form should be the same as if you're signed in (see [the creation page section](./event_creation_page.md))
